Codes from laboratory exercises in Operating Systems lecture

- Lab 1 (SignalsAndInterrupts):
Managing signals and interrupts using software support with interrupt routines that handle priority management.

- Lab 2 (MyShell):
Created a simple custom shell with basic features/commands like history, cd, ps, ! (replays a command from history) and kill.

- Lab 3 (Semaphores and Monitors):
The first code implements a problem similar to the cigarette smokers problem, managed using semaphores and processes.
The second code implements the PartyBreaker problem, managed using a monitor and threads.

- Lab 4 (PagingClockAlgorithm):
Simulation of paging a large program using the clock algorithm.
